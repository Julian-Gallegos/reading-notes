## Why this topic matters

Roy Fielding and his team are the progenitors of HTTP protocol, an important piece of history for anyone involved with HTTP protocol in their own projects. Understanding the HTTP verbs described in the REST article are mandatory for anyone trying to use HTTP.


## Rest

   1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**

'He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.' - Ryan Tomakyo

   
   2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Because the machines weren't designed for that by Fielding and his colleagues. They were focused on being able to talk to any one machine anywhere in the world.


   3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

Roy Fielding and his colleagues created verbs for HTTP protocol.


   4. **What does a `GET` do?**
     
`GET` fetches data from a separate specified machine.


   5. **What does a `POST` do?**
   
`POST` adds data to a separate specified machine
   
   
   6. **What does `PUT` do?**
   
`PUT` replaces data in a separate specified machine
   
   
   7. **What does `PATCH` do?** 

`PATCH` replaces data in a separate specified machine, and only updates the specific data sent, instead of updating everything.


## API Keys

   1. **Weather Bit API: Did you get your API key?**

Yes.


   2. **Geocoding API: Did you get your API key?**

Yes.


   3. **Yelp API Docs: Did you get your API key?**
   
Yes.
   
   
   4. **The Movie DB API Docs: Did you get your API key?**

Yes.
