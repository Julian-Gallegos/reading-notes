   - Bias:
   > We all have bias and bias is normal...it's the weaponization of bias that's dangerous
     -- John Cokos

         - Family
         - Community
         - Religion
         - Marketing
     - Conscious Bias:
       - Overt negative bias towards people that you know.
     - Implicit Bias:
       - These types of biases are not always conscious but rather the stories we've made up about people before we know who they really are
         1. Beauty Bias: Perceived successful.
         2. Affinity Bias: Warmed by same-ness.
         3. Similarity Bias: Only open to seeing ourselves in others.
         4. Halo Effect: One great thing gives a glow.
         5. Horns Effect: Put off by something then assume.
         6. Contrast Effect: Comparing to others.
         > Comparison is the thief of joy -- some pastor John Cokos knows
         7. Conformity: Groupthink.
            - In group/out group dynamics - you unfairly favor those who belong to your group.
            - Groupthink - you let the social dynamics of a group situation override the whole.
         8. Confirmation Bias:
            - Confirmation bias is the tendency of people to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. People display this bias when they gather or recall information selectively.
         9. Attribution Bias:
            - The tendency to have a different rationale for your own behavior vs. that of others.
            - Your errors is due to motives and circumstances. Another person making the same error is attributed to their character and personality.
            - It's never your fault, but someone else? "come on man how could you make that mistake"
     - Microaggressions:
       - The everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based soley upon their marginalized group membership.
     - What Can I Do?
       - Increase contact with people who are different from you.
       - Notice positive examples, and repeat them. People like to hear the postives.
       - Be specific in your intent.
       - Change the way you do things.
       - Heighten your awareness.
       - Take care of yourself.
  - Course Content Introduction
    > In 301 we really learn how the internet works -- Adam Owada
    - React will be part of the learning process throughout the course.
    - Avoid "bulldozer effect"
      - Use a technique called time boxing for the code challenges: limit yourself to an HOUR MAX when working on it. When the morning comes you can ask questions and learn more about the process.
      - Submit on time, and if you don't get full points, stick and move, focus on your current work and make up the points later if necessary. 
    - Day 1 is an exception. Normal day:
      - quick warm up
      - Code review
      - Lecture: Code challenge
      - Lab Preview
      - Lecture: Lab
      - Lunch!
      - Lab Time
      - Office Hours Daily at 3pm - 4pm (subject to change with unforseen meetings) >> NOT MANDATORY
    - Typical lectures/lab time goes from 9am to about 12:30pm
    - Agenda for today:
      - Orientation
      - Housekeeping
      - Introductions
      - Canvas - PST!
        - Who tested in?
          - Literally just me.
        - Class Expectations
      - Code Challenge Setup
        - npm install (or just i) when downloading new code challenge or lab project to set up dependancy libraries and software.
      - Lecture: Array.forEach()
        - .forEach() cannot call break like a typical for loop, it must iterate through the whole array.
        - .forEach() does not have a return.
        - Differences between arrow and nonarrow functions:
          - "this" context difference.
          - syntax different.
          - always anonymous functions.
          - Cannot be used as a constructor method.
          - No duplicate named parameters in arrow functions??
          - Why would one use an arrow function over nonarrow function.
            - Much less code and more readable.
            - Doesn't bind thids, can be used to advantage.
            - Callback functions!
        - Seperation of concerns:
          - Seperating parts of a program or design into logical sections, for example, seperating our html, css, and javascript into seperate files and folders
          - In React, the concerns change, as components are now packaged html, css, and javascript.
      - Lunch break
      - Lab 01 preview
      - Lecture: React - Components and Props
