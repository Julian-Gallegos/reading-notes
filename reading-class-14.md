## Why this topic matters

Even disregarding the benefits of diversity in the workplace, equal opportunity and respect should be celebrated and normalized. The reality is that there is still bias in the software development field, so understanding and acknowledging it is the first step towards combating it.

   1. **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

Personal computers began to show up in U.S. homes in significant numbers, and were mostly advertised towards men and boys.

   
   2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

Growing up with computers means they are more familiar with them, and with the growing trend towards men using computers, the expectation of students going into computer science is higher as professors assume all of their students used computers all their lives. This leads to women and other groups that aren't as familiar with computers to be discouraged or overwhelmed by computer courses, causing them to move to different fields.

   1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders.


   2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Diverse groups of people bring in more and different ways of seeing problems, and with many different ways of thinking the problems are typically solved faster with more efficient solutions.


   3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

A diverse organization will better represent a more diverse demographic of users as the organization has a better understanding of users with similar backgrounds from their employees.
