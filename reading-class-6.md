   1. **What is node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Unlike the V8 engine, node Node.js is a program that can execute JavaScript on our computers, as opposed to running in a browser

   
   2. **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a JavaScript engine (no duh) made to run on Chromium-based web browsers like Google Chrome, or Brave (which is what I use). It is open-source, written in C++, and designed with performance in mind when compiling JavaScript to native machine code for our computers.


   3. **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**


This means that node can execute JavaScript in its own JavaScript runtime environment, which acts like a small operating system with all the functionality necessary to run a JavaScript program.
