## Why this topic matters

Node and NPM are central to most modern day JavaScript development. Reflecting on the Benefits of Pair Programming will further the benefits of it when we bring it into practice.

   1. **What is node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Unlike the V8 engine, node Node.js is a program that can execute JavaScript on our computers, as opposed to running in a browser

   
   2. **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a JavaScript engine (no duh) made to run on Chromium-based web browsers like Google Chrome, or Brave (which is what I use). It is open-source, written in C++, and designed with performance in mind when compiling JavaScript to native machine code for our computers.


   3. **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**


This means that node can execute JavaScript in its own JavaScript runtime environment, which acts like a small operating system with all the functionality necessary to run a JavaScript program.

   4. **What is npm?**
     
It is a Node Package Manager, the primo package manger for JavaScript that Node comes bundled with.


   5. **What version of node are you running on your machine?**
   
v18.9.0
   
   
   6. **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
   
8.19.1
   
   
   7. **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**
   
npm install jshint, maybe npm install -g jshint if you want to install it globally
   
   
   8. **What is node used for?**

On top of being a runtime environment for JavaScript, Node will run various build tools that are designed to automate the process of modern JavaScript applications.


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

   1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

      1. Greater efficiency:  More bugs are caught, solutions are discussed and found sooner, and code quality is higher.
      2. Engaged collaboration: The two programmers help each other stay more engaged/focused than when coding alone. 
      3. Learning from fellow students: Students learn from each other's coding styles.
      4. Social skills: By nature of working with another, communication is key, and can be improved by pair programming.
      5. Job interview readiness: Pair programming is a common step in job interviews, so being practiced in it is vital.
      6. Work environment readiness:  Pair programming is also used during job training, so being comfortable with it means one less hurdle to overcome.


   2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

Learning from fellow students. It's easy to fall into bad practices when coding alone. I also appreciate the job interview readiness it provides.


   3. **How does pair programming work?**

The most common style works by having one programmer take the role of Driver, and the other Navigator. The Driver is the only one with their hands on the keyboard, they handle the text editor, changing files, version control, and most importantly, writing the code. The Navigator guides the Driver, thinking about the big picture and explaining the steps needed to achieve a goal. They might convert an algorithm to code for the Driver, or scan the code for typos/bugs.
