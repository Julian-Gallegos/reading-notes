## Why this topic matters

Understanding the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases as an important step to understanding the two better. Working in tech almost certainly means working with databases, so understanding the key features of them will improve your strength as a candidate to employers

   1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Complex queries are a better fit in SQL databases.

   
   2. **Give a real world example.**

Student records/grades could be stored in a sql database as a table row could be a specific student, and the columns could bename, age, gpa, courses, etc.
  

   3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Data that fits hierarchical data storage, and large data sets/big data.


   4. **Give a real world example**
     
A database representing a rooted phylogenetic tree, following the same structure where the root is the most recent common ancestor.


   5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
  
  NoSQL.
  
  
   6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**

NoSQL is best for scalability as it can be hosted easily across many database servers, making them horizontally scalable, whereas SQL databases are vertically scaled.

Tables, rows, and columns.
  
  
   4. **What is a ‘schema’?**
  
The defined structure of data stored in a database.
  
  
   5. **What is a NoSQL database?**
  
A non-relational database, or a No Structured Query Language database
  
  
   6. **How does it work?**
  

  
  
   7. **What is inside of a Mongo database?**
